# Risk Assessment Methodology

## Overview
This project follows a qualitative cybersecurity risk assessment
methodology based on evaluating the impact and likelihood of identified risks.

The objective is to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks
associated with IT assets in an organization.

## Asset Identification
Critical IT assets were identified based on their importance
to business operations, including hardware, software, networks,
and sensitive data.

## Threat Identification
Potential threats were identified for each asset, such as:
- Malware
- Phishing attacks
- SQL Injection
- Unauthorized access
- Data breaches

## Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerabilities represent weaknesses that could be exploited
by threats, including weak passwords, lack of user awareness,
and improper security controls.

## Risk Scoring Method
Risk is calculated using the following formula:

Risk Score = Impact × Likelihood

Where:
- Impact is rated on a scale of 1 (Low) to 5 (Very High)
- Likelihood is rated on a scale of 1 (Rare) to 5 (Very Likely)

## Risk Classification
Based on the calculated risk score, risks are classified as:

- Low Risk: 1–6
- Medium Risk: 7–14
- High Risk: 15–25

## Risk Treatment
Appropriate mitigation strategies are proposed based on
the severity of each risk to reduce impact or likelihood.
